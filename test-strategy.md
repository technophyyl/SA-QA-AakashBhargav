Our Plan for Testing Sauce Demo: A Quality Assurance Strategy

What We're Testing: A Quick Look at Sauce Demo
Sauce Demo (you can find it at https://www.saucedemo.com) is an online store that's specifically designed for us to practice and test our automated user interface (UI) systems. On this site, people can do all the usual things you'd expect from an e-commerce site: log in, browse products, add items to their shopping cart, go through the checkout process, and finally see a confirmation of their order.

For testing purposes, we have a couple of special login accounts:
- standard_user with the password secret_sauce gives us full access to the site.
- locked_out_user is for checking what happens when someone tries to log in but isn't allowed.

What Could Go Wrong: Our Main Concerns
When we're testing, we're particularly worried about these key areas, as they could really impact our users or our business:
- Wrong Checkout Prices: If the website calculates the total price incorrectly during checkout, customers might be charged too much or too little. This can seriously damage their trust in us.
- Login Problems: We need to make sure that people who aren't supposed to log in (like locked_out_user) are properly blocked. Also, if there are error messages, they need to be clear and easy to understand, so users don't get confused.
- Shopping Cart Mix-ups: When customers add or remove items, their cart needs to update perfectly. If it doesn't, they might end up with the wrong items in their final order.
- Checkout Form Mistakes: The forms where customers enter their shipping and payment details shouldn't accept invalid information (like leaving important fields blank). This could lead to orders that can't be fulfilled correctly.
- Website Not Updating Visually: Some parts of the website, like the little number badge that shows how many items are in your cart, should change instantly. If these dynamic elements don't update, it could mislead users about their order status.

Our focus on these risks is because they directly relate to how customers buy things and log in, which are crucial for our revenue and for providing a good experience.

What We'll Automate First: Our Top Priorities
Given our testing goals, here’s what we’re automating first:
- The Smooth Shopping Experience ("Happy Path"): Our absolute top priority is to automate the entire successful journey a customer takes: logging in, adding an item to their cart, completing the checkout, and confirming their order. This test covers the most common way people use the site and helps us catch problems across many different parts (login, cart, checkout). We're doing this first because it's the most frequent thing users do, and it has a big impact on our business.
- Testing a Failed Login: Our second priority is to automate a test where we try to log in with the locked_out_user account. We'll then check to make sure the correct error message appears. This ensures our system handles incorrect login attempts properly, which is a common source of bugs. We chose this as the second test to make sure we're testing both successful and unsuccessful scenarios within our time limit.
- Tests We'll Do Later: Some tests, like trying to check out with an empty cart or buying many different items, will be done later. They're not as critical as ensuring the main shopping flow and error handling work correctly, especially given our initial time constraints.

How Our Tests Will Run Automatically: Integration with Our Development Process
Our automated tests will run automatically every time a developer proposes changes to our code (called a "pull request") using a system called GitHub Actions. To make sure the tests run the same way for everyone, no matter if they're using a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer, we'll run them inside a Docker container. This creates a consistent testing environment and avoids those "it works on my machine!" issues.

We'll use Playwright to run these tests in a "headless" mode, meaning the browser window won't actually pop up on screen. This makes the tests run much faster. We'll also run multiple tests at the same time ("parallel execution") to save even more time. If a test fails because of a temporary internet issue, we'll give it one more try to prevent false alarms.

After the tests run, an easy-to-read HTML report will be saved in a folder called reports/. This lets our developers quickly see what passed and what failed. We'll also use TypeScript's type checking during this automated process to catch any coding errors early on.

The Tools We're Using
We've carefully chosen specific tools because they help us build reliable and efficient tests:
- Playwright: This tool is excellent for interacting with dynamic parts of our website. It automatically waits for elements to appear, which means we don't have to guess how long to wait, reducing flaky tests and failures.
- TypeScript: Using TypeScript helps us write more reliable code. It catches common errors (like trying to use the wrong type of information for a web element) before the tests even run, making our test code easier to maintain.
- Headless Browser: Running tests in a "headless" browser (without a visible window) saves computer resources and is perfect for running tests quickly and efficiently in our automated system.

This overall strategy focuses on the most important and risky parts of the Sauce Demo site, uses dependable tools, and fits smoothly into our development process. This ensures we get quick feedback on our code and build a test suite that's easy to manage and update.
